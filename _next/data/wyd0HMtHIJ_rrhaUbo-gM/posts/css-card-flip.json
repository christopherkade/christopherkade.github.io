Bear with me while I revisit my childhood please, and in the meantime, let's have some fun with CSS ü•∞\n\n> If you wish to jump right into the solution, here's the [Codesandbox link](https://codesandbox.io/s/hopeful-worker-icrcnh?file=/index.html), enjoy !\n\n![The animation taught in this post](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nusrv418m4kafficsvjj.gif)\n\n## Step 1: Create the wrapper üéÅ\n\n```html\n<div class=\"card-wrapper\"></div>\n```\n\n```css\n// Our card flip animation, simply rotates the element on the Y\n// axis and then goes back to its original state\n@keyframes cardFlip {\n  0% {\n    transform: rotateY(0deg);\n  }\n  50% {\n    transform: rotateY(180deg);\n  }\n  100% {\n    transform: rotateY(0deg);\n  }\n}\n\n.card-wrapper {\n  position: relative;\n  transform-style: preserve-3d;\n  animation: cardFlip 3s ease-in-out infinite;\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 150px;\n}\n```\n\nHere `transform-style` defines each children element as 3D. When used in conjunction with `backface-visibility` and `transform`, it will allow us to use the back and front as tangible 3D objects that can be rotated.\n\n## Step 2: Create each card face üé¥\n\n```html\n<div class=\"card-wrapper\">\n  <img class=\"card\" src=\"front.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n  <img class=\"card card-back\" src=\"back.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n.card {\n  position: absolute;\n  backface-visibility: hidden;\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 150px;\n}\n\n// By default, we rotate the back of the card out of view\n// This way, when the animation triggers, the front and back\n// swap places back and forth\n.card-back {\n  transform: rotateY(180deg);\n}\n```\n\n`backface-visibility` defines the back of the card as hidden by default, this way, when it turns, we won't simply see the same face twice.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's it, short and sweet.  \nI struggled a bit to implement it at first and figured it would be worth documenting !  \nWhether you play Magic: the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Flesh and Blood, Vanguard or any other TCG, I'm sure you'll find that animation a bit nostalgic.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christo_kade) (if it's still around by the time you read this article) - it's always fun chatting with some of you and sharing tips & tricks together üòÑ\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
