Youâ€™ll be redirected to GitHub.\n\n- Click the green Activate button, and activate the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.\n\n<br>\n\n### <a name=\"configure\"></a> Step 2: Configure the CI process for your repository\n\nTo do so, add a `.travis.yml` file at the **root** of your repository, this file will basically tell Travis what to do and in what order.  \nThankfully, the process is simplified, especially when it comes to deploying to Github pages, take a look at this example:\n\n```yaml\n# Important for the Travis container set up\nlanguage: \"node_js\" # Language used by the project\nnode_js: \"8\" # Node version used\n\ncache:\n  directories:\n    - \"node_modules\" # Travis will cache node_modules so it doesn't reinstall them every time\n\n# Lifecycle job, will execute the actions bellow before the build and deployment.\n# Find other build lifecycle hooks here: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/job-lifecycle\nbefore_script:\n  - npm run lint\n\n# This is where the magic happens, Travis handles Github pages deployment automatically\ndeploy:\n  provider: pages # Tells Travis we're deploying on Github Pages\n  skip-cleanup: true # Make sure you have it set to true\n  github-token: $GITHUB_TOKEN # See notes bellow\n  local_dir: dist # The directory to deploy\n  repo: github_username/repository_name # For example christopherkade/christopherkade.github.io\n  target_branch: master # Branch to be deployed on\n  on:\n    branch: code # Deployement only triggered when code is pushed on the code branch\n```\n\nNote that the `$GITHUB_TOKEN` must be set up directly in the repository's Settings on the Travis client.\n\nTo get that token, follow these brief [instructions](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/#setting-the-github-token).\n\n<br>\n\n### Step 3: <a name=\"trigger\"></a> Trigger your first Travis CI build\n\nTo do so, start by adding, committing and pushing your `.travis.yml` file to Git.  \nYou can now go back to the Travis client and see your build status.\n\nIf said build fails for reasons you cannot understand through the logs, feel free to check out [common build problems](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/).\n\nIf not, your Github page is now up and running thanks to the `deploy` statement in your configuration file. The deployment is visible as one of the very last logs of your build.\n\nI hope this was useful to some of you, as discovering CI has truly made my development process more enjoyable as a whole.\n\nHave a good one :-)  \n[@christo_kade](https://twitter.com/christo_kade)\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
