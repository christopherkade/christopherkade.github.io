It makes it so that every child of our `nav` takes advantage of the flex context.  \nWe can now start moving around the container's children.\n\n<br>\n\n### justify-content\n\n```css\nnav {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around\n    | space-evenly;\n}\n```\n\nIt determines where we place our container's elements on the main axis.  \nEach one is pretty self explanatory but it's worth playing around with it.\n\nIn our case, we want our items to be on the right (the end) of the navbar:\n\n```css\nnav {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n}\n```\n\n\"But Chris, by using the value `flex-end` **everything** goes to the end of my container, even the icon !\", and you're absolutely right, we want our icon to be on the left while everything else is on the right. To do so, we can use a pretty neat trick, we set the icon's `margin-right` to auto, telling our layout to automatically place the icon to the far left like so.\n\n```css\n/* Target the first link in our navbar (the icon)  */\nnav > a:first-child {\n  margin-right: auto;\n}\n```\n\nEverything is starting to look better, although we still need to center our icon vertically.\n\n<br>\n\n### align-items\n\n```css\nnav {\n  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline;\n}\n```\n\nIt determines the position of the container's children on the cross axis (the axis perpendicular to the one used by `justify-content`).\n\nIn our case, we want to align our navbar items vertically, like so:\n\n```css\nnav {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's it, we have a fully fledged navbar and we learned three essential concepts of Flexbox ! üéâ\n\n<br>\n\n### Bonus: flex-direction\n\nEven though we're not using it here, I think it's worth mentioning `flex-direction`.\n\n```css\n.container {\n  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;\n}\n```\n\nJust like its name entails, it determines the container's main axis, think of it as creating a horizontal (by default) or vertical layout.\n\nTry it out ! You'll see that defining it as `column` will have the expected result: a vertical layout.\n\n<br>\n\n## Going a bit further with a card list\n\nAlright, you may have seen the [example UI](https://codepen.io/christopherkade/pen/MdyQJE) shared earlier, we'll now work on creating this card layout and have it be responsive (which is made very easy thanks to Flexbox).\n\nHere what our HTML will look like:\n\n```html\n<article class=\"card-container\">\n  <div class=\"card\">\n    <a class=\"card-link\" href=\"#\">\n      <time>May 4, 2019 | 3 min read</time>\n      <span>\n        <h2 class=\"card-title\">My awesome card</h2>\n        <p class=\"card-description\">...with a description !</p>\n      </span>\n    </a>\n  </div>\n\n  <!-- More cards below -->\n</article>\n```\n\nWe will display a large amount of cards on **multiple lines**, these can be articles (like on [christopherkade.com](https://christopherkade.com/blog)), TODOs or anything you'd like.\n\nTo do so, we only need one new concept: `flex-wrap`.\n\n<br>\n\n### flex-wrap\n\nIt tells our container to wrap its items onto multiple lines when needed. By default `flex` will fit every item on the same line.\n\n```css\n.card-container {\n  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;\n}\n```\n\nSo, our `.card-container` will now look like the following:\n\n```css\n.card-container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n```\n\n> Try moving your window's size around, it's responsive and will render the the amount of cards that can fit each line automatically.\n\n<br>\n\n## Wait, that's it?\n\nYeah, it's not hard to get started with Flexbox. Of course there's much more to it, but that's more than enough to produce cool layouts.\n\nIf you want to go further, make sure to check out CSS-Trick's [Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) which was the main inspiration to write this post.\n\nOf course, if you have any questions concerning Flexbox, CSS as a whole or Javascript, don't hesitate to send them to me on Twitter [@christo_kade](https://twitter.com/christo_kade) üòÑ\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
