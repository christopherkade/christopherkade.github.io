It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.\"\n\nIt is widely used by the tech-blogging community and more importantly, is extremely easy to set up with Github pages !\n\n<br><br>\n\n## What is Github Pages?\n\n[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows any Github user to host a static website directly from a Github repository, all free of charge.\n\nThe website you are currently viewing is one of them, and so is my [personal website](http://christopherkade.com) !\n\nOn this blog post we'll focus solely on the deployment of a **Jekyll blog**, but I might write about how to deploy an Angular4 website in the near future.\n\n<br><br>\n\n## Step 1: Setup Github Pages\n\n<br>\n\n#### Start by creating a repository named `username.github.io`\n\nReplace `username` with your Github username (so in my case, I have inputed `christopherkade.github.io`):\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15229355/32519362-68ac7a50-c404-11e7-8931-136c43710089.png\">\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n#### Then clone your repository (this example uses a terminal):\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io\n```\n\n<br>\n\n#### In order to test that everything works as intended, enter the project folder and add an `index.html` file:\n\n```bash\ncd username.github.io\necho \"Hello World\" > index.html\n```\n\n<br>\n\n#### Finally, push it:\n\n```bash\ngit add --all\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\ngit push -u origin master\n```\n\nAnd that's all you need ! Open up your browser of choice and go to `https://username.github.io`.\n\n<br><br>\n\n## Step 2: Setup Jekyll\n\n<br>\n\n#### Let's start by generating Jekyll's starter blog (make sure you are root):\n\n```bash\ngem install jekyll bundler\njekyll new my-blog\ncd my-blog\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n```\n\n<br><br>\n\n## Step 3: Deploy our Jekyll blog\n\nEverything is explained [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), but in short:\n\nYou must use a gem (a Ruby package) created by the Github Pages team.\nAdd it to your `Gemfile`:\n\n```Gemfile\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\n\ngem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins\n```\n\nRun `bundle update`.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Deploy everything to your Github Pages repository\n\nAll we have to do is push the contents of our Jekyll repository to our `username.github.io` repository.\n\nTo do so (in your Jekyll blog repository):\n\n```bash\n# initialize the local directory as Git repository\ngit init\n\n# add the files in our Jekyll repository\ngit add .\n\n# commit them\ngit commit -m \"Initial blog commit\"\n\n# don't forget to replace the remote URL with your own\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io\n\n# check if the remote URL is correct\ngit remote -v\n\n# finally, push everything to the master branch\ngit push origin master\n```\n\nAnd **voil√†** ! Your Jekyll blog should be up and running, you can now start blogging at your hearts content.\n\n<br><br>\n\n## Optional: personalize your blog\n\nYou can always personalize your Jekyll blog with various themes, for example, this blog uses [John Otander](http://johnotander.com/)'s [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll/) theme.\n\nIt might take a short while to have everything set up, but it's a rather simple process that is very similar to what you have just achieved. Don't forget to check out Jekyll's [official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) for more information on theming.\n\n<br><br>\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nGithub Pages and Jekyll are two very cool free tools that should be used by anyone who wishes to set up a personal blog, website or project. There is a **lot** of documentation out there to help you achieve your goals, like setting up a domain and custom domain.\n\nI hope this post has been of help to some of you,  \nUntil next time,  \n[@christo_kade](https://twitter.com/christo_kade)\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
