The whole point of this practice is to find a consensus on problems and to produce something of greater quality as everyone can partake in the conversation. If you already know of _pair programming_ (which involves two developers) then you probably already noted that it's a similar concept but extended to a whole team.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\" src=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2016/09/mob-programming.jpg\">\n</p>\n\n<br><br>\n\n## How can it help\n\nI briefly mentioned why this practice can be useful, but I think it's worth going into details with some examples.\n\n<br>\n\n### <a name=\"team\"></a> As a team\n\nMob Programming involves the team in every aspect that goes into software development, from defining stories, to designing, testing and deploying. By thinking as a group, developers tend to bounce ideas off each other and find better solutions.\n\nIt also allows the team to go over their knowledge on the subject and perhaps explain it to people who may not have delved into a certain framework or design pattern, allowing them to have a concrete introduction to it.  \nDisparity of level may be the most complicated aspect to manage in Mob Programming in my opinion, as some individuals may feel left out or out of sync with the rest of the group, to avoid getting to that point, make sure to ask if everyone is following rather often and if someone seems to participate much less than others, try to include them through broader implementation questions.\n\nFinally, it can help a team get closer overall, as it will create a deeper professional bond built over problem-solving and discussion.\n\n<br>\n\n### <a name=\"individually\"></a> Individually\n\nOn an individual level, Mob Programming has obvious advantages.\n\nFor example, my last session had us take someone's project and tackle some of their bugs and issues. By taking a feature and applying good TDD practices to it all together I managed to understand some concepts on a deeper and more concrete level. Additionally, I did not hesitate to ask for precisions when something was being typed and was not clear to me, without disrupting the flow of the work.\n\n<br><br>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI'm sure most of you already heard or used this concept in your current jobs, but hopefully some of you may be inspired to give it a try and understand the benefit of working alongside individuals who may think differently.\n\nThanks for reading,  \nHave a good one :-)  \n[@christo_kade](https://twitter.com/christo_kade)\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
