<h2>Characteristics of quality requirement statements</h2>
<p>In order to define good software requirements, one should always keep in mind 6 distinct characteristics.</p>
<!-- -->&lt;br&gt;<!-- -->
<h4>A software requirement must be...</h4>
<h3>Correct</h3>
<p>Every requirement must accurately describe the functionality to be delivered.</p>
<h3>Feasible</h3>
<p>The implementation of the functionality must be realistic and possible within the known capabilities and limitations of the system and its environment.</p>
<h3>Necessary</h3>
<p>A requirement should represent something the customer really needs.</p>
<h3>Prioritized</h3>
<p>Each requirement needs to have an implementation priority in order to facilitate reaction to new requirements being added, a team changing or when facing budget cuts.</p>
<h3>Unambiguous</h3>
<p>A requirement should deliver one interpretation, no matter the reader. Therefore subjective words should be avoided and succinct, simple language should be used.</p>
<h3>Verifiable</h3>
<p>A requirement must and will be tested by its developers, therefore it must be possible to devise test cases for it.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;<!-- -->&lt;br&gt;</p>
<h2>Characteristics of quality requirement specifications</h2>
<p>Requirements statements are only a small part of a larger product / system, with that in mind, we must consider how individual requirement statements hold alongside other existing and new requirement statements. Which leads us to look into characteristics of quality requirement specifications.</p>
<p>A software requirements specification (SRS) is a &quot;description of a software system to be developed. It lays out functional and non-functional requirements, and may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide&quot; (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>In order to have the best SRS possible, it should follow these characteristics.</p>
<!-- -->&lt;br&gt;<!-- -->
<h4>A software requirements specification must be...</h4>
<h3>Complete</h3>
<p>No necessary information or requirements should be missing in order to develop the product.</p>
<h3>Consistent</h3>
<p>It is vital that requirements do not conflict with other requirements.</p>
<h3>Modifiable</h3>
<p>One must be able to modify a requirement without impeding on other requirements. This brings up the necessity of grouping up requirements that are linked, and to create a cross-reference listing.</p>
<h3>Traceable</h3>
<p>Linking each requirement to its source is essential, to achieve it, each requirement must be written in a structured and precise way (as opposed to a narrative and large approach).</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;<!-- -->&lt;br&gt;</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Agile software development took its rightful place as it advocates continuous improvements, adaptive planning alongside many other principles. Utilizing it to its full and best potential can be a daunting task for any newcomer like myself, but I hope this short blog post covers my general understanding of defining quality requirements for a project to a good degree.</p>
