I find that rebuilding my website gives me a project outside of work to constantly work on, and allows me to apply acquired knowledge in a concrete manner. I&#x27;m also pretty picky when it comes to design, and I often get bored of the ones I&#x27;ve built in the past.</p>
<p>But one of the things I haven&#x27;t truly tackled is performance. Why? Because I&#x27;ve always perceived my website as something that has very little information and that therefore should not require optimization of that sort. But the more I try to push the website&#x27;s style, the more I realize that performance should be a priority for every project I work on.</p>
<p>This post goes over every aspect of performance I have considered while going through what I&#x27;ve learned and applied.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;<!-- -->&lt;br&gt;</p>
<h2>Minifying my stylesheets</h2>
<p>In order to remove some bytes from my file sizes, minifying my stylesheets seemed like an obvious first thing to do.</p>
<p>The great thing about <strong>Angular CLI</strong> is that when building my project for production, it automatically minifies my stylesheets for me.</p>
<p><code>ng build --env=prod</code></p>
<p>The effects of the minification can be seen in the <code>styles.bundle.js</code> file generated in the <code>dist</code> folder.</p>
<p>In any case where this process would not be automatic, and when using a pre-processor like <strong>Sass</strong>, it is possible to configure it to automatically minify compiled CSS.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;<!-- -->&lt;br&gt;</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<!-- -->&lt;br&gt;<!-- -->
<h3>Reducing image file sizes</h3>
<p>By compressing the pictures of my <a href="https://christopherkade.com/projects">projects</a> I was able to bring some images from 1.4 MB down to 50kB.</p>
<p>I had to compress them at the cost of visual quality, but my images being divided by rows, this would not affect the user&#x27;s experience. Many tools are available online such as <a href="http://compressimage.toolur.com/">this</a> one.<br/>
<!-- -->When exporting and selecting the quality level, I have chosen the lowest level possible while keeping an acceptable quality.</p>
<!-- -->&lt;br&gt;<!-- -->
<h3>Using progressive JPEG</h3>
<p>Progressive JPEG are simple to create and have little to no performance penalty, the upside is that they appear sooner on the page itself.<br/>
<!-- -->In order to change a JPEG to its progressive counterpart many tools are available <a href="https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/make-jpeg-progressive-without-compression.php">online</a>.</p>
<p>The difference is astonishing, dropping the fetching of the images down to [27ms - 101ms] coming from upwards of [361ms - 510ms].</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;<!-- -->&lt;br&gt;</p>
<h2>What else could be done?</h2>
<p>Many other forms of performance optimization could be applied, but some of them aren&#x27;t relevant to this website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using async to load scripts</li>
<li>Avoiding inline / embedded code</li>
<li>Avoiding unnecessary dom manipulations</li>
<li>And many other little tweaks that influence a website&#x27;s performance</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this post will be a call to action for some of you to consider performance in your development choices, it&#x27;s very rewarding to be able to see improvements on your projects and is an incremental task that must be considered at the beginning of every project.</p>
