<h2>ECMA? TC39?</h2>
<p>In 1959, computers were being used more and more, which brought in multiple new manufacturers. Something was clear: they needed to find a way to standardize technical operations such as (but not only) programming.</p>
<p>And so, the 27th of April 1960 in Brussels, the European Computer Manufacturers Association (or ECMA) was born, looking to standardize this mess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: in 1994, ECMA became ecma international, where they dropped the acronym and used the latter word to show their international scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ECMA elects a new president every single year, usually someone from a major actor in computer science: IBM, HP, Siemens, Philips etc. Jochen Friedrick from IBM currently resides as president for the 2018-2019 period.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s how it&#x27;s structured:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52913438/67367591-180d9480-f576-11e9-8386-2eebf29d748b.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>The general assembly includes ordinary members of ecma and is its highest authority. It controls its management, secretariat &amp; executive committee. It&#x27;s currently composed of some of the biggest names in tech, including Apple, AirBnb, Facebook, Netflix &amp; Google. <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/members.htm">Full list of members</a></p>
<p>It&#x27;s the secretariat&#x27;s role to organize and create Technical Committees (TCs) and Technical Groups (TGs) who handle specific aspects of computer science.</p>
<p>Each TC manages the evolution &amp; future of things such as Programming Languages, Product Safety and of course: ECMAScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52913438/67367895-b4379b80-f576-11e9-89a9-b966c4907ea0.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>You now have a general overview of how things work, but what&#x27;s the lifecycle of a new JS feature?</p>
<h2>TC39 proposals</h2>
<p>So TC39 manages the evolution of our beloved (and sometimes hated) language, almost everything they do is <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals">open-sourced</a> so it&#x27;s always cool to check out new proposals and how they evolve over time.</p>
<h2>The stages of an ECMAScript feature</h2>
<p>A new ECMAScript feature goes through 5 stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stage 0</strong> (Strawperson): which allows initial input into the specification</li>
<li><strong>Stage 1</strong> (Proposal): allows to make the case for the addition, describe the shape of the solution &amp; identify potential challenges</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2</strong> (Draft): allows to precisely describe the syntax and semantic using formal specification language</li>
<li><strong>Stage 3</strong> (Candidate): indicates that further refinement will require feedback from implementations &amp; users. Basically requires that all semantics, syntax and APIs are completely described</li>
<li><strong>Stage 4</strong> (Finished): Indicate that the addition is ready for inclusion in the formal ECMAScript standard</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get more information and dive into great details about these stages <a href="https://tc39.es/process-document/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Stage 4 features</h2>
<p>Let&#x27;s get to concrete stage 4 features, meaning features that are finished and that will be included in the soonest practical standard version of ECMAScript. I&#x27;ll also display their current browser support.</p>

<h2>Stage 3 features</h2>
<p>Stage 3 features won&#x27;t get released in the near future, but some of them are so cool that it&#x27;s worth mentioning them.<br/>
<!-- -->I won&#x27;t mention their browser support though, as it&#x27;s not relevant.</p>
