<!-- -->For the past month, I&#x27;ve been consulting with a team that truly values the points I&#x27;ll share with you today, and I&#x27;ve been able to see the positive effects they&#x27;ve had on a large-scale project.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556075798-4825dfaaf498?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2110&amp;q=80" alt=""/></p>
<h2>Naming conventions</h2>
<p>Git naming conventions are <strong>key</strong>. They allow you to understand the context of somebody&#x27;s work in a matter of seconds and can help you filter through your team&#x27;s work when well executed.</p>
<p>There isn&#x27;t a perfect naming convention out there, but some of them, like <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Vincent Driessen&#x27;s</a> make a lot of sense and will clarify the mess that can be naming Git branches.<br/>
<!-- -->In short, other than your usual <code>master</code> and <code>dev</code> branches, your <em>supporting</em> branches can be of the following types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature branches</strong> (<code>feature-*</code>): takes the form of a user story, or a feature that will be merged later on</li>
<li><strong>Release branches</strong> (<code>release-*</code>): support the preparation of new product release, say a future rebranding of your website and will be eventually merged when ready</li>
<li><strong>Hotfix branches</strong> (<code>hotfix-*</code>): your typical bug fix. You could, for example, branch off in order to fix a bug in production</li>
</ul>
<p>But naming conventions also apply to <strong>commit messages</strong>. I truly recommend Chris Beam&#x27;s <a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">&quot;How to Write a Git Commit Message&quot;</a> in order to grasp the importance of carefully naming your commits. But I think the following guidelines are a good summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
<li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</li>
<li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
<li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
<li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line</li>
<li>Wrap the body at 72 characters</li>
<li>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how</li>
</ul>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to use the sentence: <em>if applied, this commit will...</em> and end it with your commit&#x27;s title. If it makes no sense, you might want to reconsider it.<br/>
<!-- -->For example: <em>if applied, this commit will remove all deprecated methods</em> sounds great, whereas <em>if applied, this commit will fix bug #123</em> doesn&#x27;t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: if you&#x27;re using a tool such as Jira you could incorporate your ticket numbers in both your branch names and commit messages in order to make it easier to cross check.<br/>
<!-- -->Also, don&#x27;t forget that these are just tips, and that at the end of the day you can always follow your own path. We&#x27;ll all end up with some &#x27;please work&#x27; commit messages here and there. 😄</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Github labels</h2>
<p>Github labels are another great way of filtering through your pull requests. So here are some labels I&#x27;ve found useful in the past and their meaning (when it isn&#x27;t obvious):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good first issue</strong>: especially great when your project is open-source and looking for new contributors. It&#x27;s a great entry point for anyone too afraid to help out</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bug</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tech</strong>: means the associated pull request isn&#x27;t about a client-facing feature. It could be about your project&#x27;s <code>eslint</code> or <code>storybook</code> configurations for example</li>
<li><strong>Critical</strong>: helps your team know which PRs are worth reviewing first, especially when on a tight deadline</li>
<li><strong>Help wanted</strong></li>
<li><strong>In progress</strong></li>
<li><strong>XS</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>M</strong>, <strong>L</strong> and <strong>XL</strong>: represents the size of the PR at a quick glance. It&#x27;s hard to determine how many lines changed will make up for any of these sizes, it&#x27;s all up to you</li>
<li><strong>Review needed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reviewed</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Labels can be changed by clicking on the following link in your pull requests page:</p>
<p><img src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/cr3l08b0ijqgdlhnj2n5.png" alt="labels link screenshot"/></p>
<p>It&#x27;s now as simple as clicking on &quot;New label&quot;, setting a name, optional description and a color.</p>
<p><img src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sfb9stdlkkea9pasf4pm.png" alt="new label screenshot"/></p>
<h2>Protecting Git branches</h2>
<p>You can limit branch manipulation by, for example, enforcing a required status before merging a given branch. This is great when you&#x27;ve set code review rules and don&#x27;t want anyone to mistakenly merge a branch.</p>
<p>As admin of a project, go to <code>Settings</code> =&gt; <code>Branches</code> =&gt; <code>Add rule</code> and input the name of the branch you wish to protect.</p>
<p>You can chose from a number of rules, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring X pull request reviews before merging</li>
<li>Requiring status checks to pass before merging, great when you have a robust CI process in place</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating Git hooks</h2>
<p>I&#x27;ll quote the <a href="https://githooks.com/">official docs</a> for this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as <strong>commit</strong>, <strong>push</strong> and <strong>receive</strong>. Git hooks are a built-in feature - no need to download anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every Git repository has a .git/hooks folder with a script for each hook you can bind to. You&#x27;re free to change or update these scripts as necessary, and Git will execute them when those events occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;d recommend using awesome tools such as <a href="https://github.com/typicode/husky">Husky</a> in order to create them easily.</p>
<p>Automatically executing your tests and blocking a push if they fail will go a <strong>long way</strong> to avoid polluting your git history.</p>
<h2>Honorable mentions</h2>
<p>I&#x27;d like to mention something I use regularaly on personal projects such as <a href="https://github.com/christopherkade/foodpicker">Foodpicker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/christopherkade/banner-generator">Banner Generator</a> or <a href="https://github.com/christopherkade/gitignore-it">Gitignore It</a> (if you&#x27;re curious, check out their Git history): 🎨 ⚡️ <a href="https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/">Gitmoji</a> 🔥 🐛! It&#x27;s a way of codifying your commit messages using emojis, this way you can understand the <strong>context</strong> of a commit at a glance. Some might dismiss it right away due to its colorful nature, but I&#x27;ve found it very useful to generate changelogs for example.</p>
<p>Some awesome tools such as <a href="https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli">gitmoji-cli</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frinyvonnick/gitmoji-changelog">gitmoji-changelog</a> make my Git experience smoother on a daily basis, so make sure to check them out if you&#x27;re interested !</p>
