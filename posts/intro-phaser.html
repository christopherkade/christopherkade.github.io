<blockquote>
<p>Phaser is an HTML5 game framework which aims to help developers make powerful, cross-browser HTML5 games really quickly and, unlike some others, has solely been built to work with the mobile browsers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will also try to add my struggles and little snippets of advice I get along the way.</p>
<h2>The beginning</h2>
<p>Curiosity led me to Phaser&#x27;s <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started/index">getting started tutorial</a>, where I got to follow basic steps to set up my working environment.</p>
<p>These steps included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Installing an http server</strong>: I chose <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server"><code>http-server</code></a> as it is simple to use, requires little to no configuration and is powerful enough for production usage.</li>
<li><strong>Selecting my editor</strong>: I decided to keep on using my favorite text editor, namely <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Downloading Phaser</strong>: as it is an open-source project, it was as easy as cloning the repository locally.</li>
<li><strong>Testing it out</strong>: using their &quot;Hello World&quot; example where I displayed a black game area with their logo by launching my HTTP server, having it serve my game&#x27;s folder (<code>http-server ./my-game/</code>) and navigating to the displayed link.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The next step</h2>
<p>As the tutorial recommended, I then proceeded to the <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game">Making your first Phaser game</a> tutorial.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a thoroughly well explained tutorial, where little to no prior knowledge is required.<br/>
<!-- -->All the assets can be found <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/raw/master/v2/resources/tutorials/02%20Making%20your%20first%20game/phaser_tutorial_02.zip">here</a> and the code is already available in the Phaser repository cloned beforehand (in the <code>resources/tutorials</code> folder).</p>
<p>It is divided as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: where we download the tutorial&#x27;s files and check out an <code>html</code> file containing the baseline for our game (namely the instance of a <code>Phaser.Game</code> object).</li>
<li><strong>Loading Assets</strong>: where we load assets to our game in the <code>preload()</code> method defined in the previous step. We then create a sprite in our canvas. Let&#x27;s not forget that all of this is accessible thanks to our HTTP server, just serve the right directory and launch <code>http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port/part3.html</code> in your browser of choice.</li>
</ul>

  &lt;img width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part3.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>World Building</strong>: where we build a scene with a background and platforms. Similar to the previous section, but it is composed of a <code>sky</code> background instead of the <code>star</code>, the former is a 800x600 PNG that fills the game screen. We also create a <code>platform</code> group that contains the ground and the 2 ledges we can jump on.</li>
</ul>

  &lt;img width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part4.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Groups (and a player)</strong>: where we learn about the usage of <code>group</code>s, as they allow to group together similar objects and control them as one unit (we have already created a group that contained the platforms). We then create a new variable called player giving it a position and a sprite sheet (loaded in the <em>Loading assets</em> part), enable its physics, set its physics properties (bounce, gravity &amp; collisions) and finally add its walking animations (right and left), while defining the corresponding images in our sprite sheet, the amount of FPS and if it should loop.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/dude.png" alt=""/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here&#x27;s what our player&#x27;s sprite sheet looks like, it contains our running and standing frames</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15229355/32609741-8dd1362c-c558-11e7-9f93-e32ca03b4a1d.png" alt=""/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Body and velocity (physics)</strong>: where we learn that <em>Phaser</em> supports a lot of different physics systems (it ships with Arcade and Ninja and P2.JS Full-Body Physics). We must enable the physics property for every sprite or group that should be affected. This gives a new <code>body</code> property to our element which offers a lot of properties such as <code>player.body.gravity.y</code>. We also notice that the player does not stand on the ground we have set beforehand, that&#x27;s because we need to introduce a <em>collision check</em> between the player and the platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part6.png" alt=""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Controls</strong>: where we set up our keyboard controls. To do so we start by setting our player&#x27;s body velocity to 0 in order to reset his movements, then we define a <code>cursors</code> variable containing <code>game.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys()</code> that will be checked at every frame in <code>update()</code> in order to catch a keypress, for example if <code>cursors.left.isDown</code> is true, then our user has pressed the left key. We can also let our user jump by checking if he is touching the ground (in order to avoid mid-air jumps) and if the up key has been pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goals</strong>: in this part, we create a star group that contains 12 stars to our scene (evenly spread out), set each of their gravity value and randomly assign a bounce value (between 0 - no bounce and 1 - full bounce). Let&#x27;s not forget to enable physics for every star using <code>stars.enableBody = true</code> and to add collision between our newly created stars and the platform. Finally, using the <code>overlap</code> method, we catch when our player touches a star and call the <code>collectStar</code> method that simply kills a star in order to have it disapear from the scene using <code>star.kill()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part8.png" alt=""/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Score</strong>: finally, using the <code>Phaser.Text</code> object, we add the player&#x27;s score in the scenes top-left. We also add an incrementation in the previously created <code>collectStar</code> method and change the text at the same time to display the player&#x27;s progress.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Thoughts on this tutorial</h3>
<p>This tutorial was a pleasure to go through, it explains Phaser&#x27;s core concepts with the right amount of details, is illustrated and progresses to a reasonable pace. Finishing it gives you so many ideas to add to this little example, and the possibilities seem endless (with proportional work of course).</p>
<p>I will add content to this post as I keep on using Phaser in the near future, but I hope this introduction was interesting enough to tingle your interest, feel free to check out the amazing documentation and examples given on Phaser&#x27;s <a href="http://phaser.io/">website</a>.</p>
<h3>Game updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have cleaned up the tutorial&#x27;s code by splitting it into distinct methods (for example <code>setUpStars()</code> which simply creates our star group and its content)</li>
<li>I added enemies to the game using the &#x27;baddie.png&#x27; asset, when a user touches an ennemy, he dies and may restart the game by pressing [Space]</li>
<li>I have added an &#x27;end&#x27; to this little game, when all of our stars are collected, the user is congratulated and may restart the game by pressing [Space]</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please keep in mind that I do not know any of the best practices yet !</em></p>
<p>All of these changes can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/christopherkade/phaser-game-example">repository</a>.</p>
