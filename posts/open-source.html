<h3>What should I do?</h3>
<p>It&#x27;s pretty straight forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find an open-source project to work on (ideally one you&#x27;re using or used in the past)</li>
<li>Fork it</li>
<li>Clone it</li>
<li>Read the contribution guidelines (usually in a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file in the root of the repo: <a href="https://github.com/SSENSE/vue-carousel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">example</a>)</li>
<li>Create a branch</li>
<li>Implement the new feature/fix</li>
<li>Commit it</li>
<li>Push it</li>
<li>Submit your changes for review via a pull request</li>
<li>Once your pull request is merged, delete the branch you worked on</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that these steps might not be complete depending on the project you&#x27;re working on. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s essential to read the contribution guidelines thoroughly!</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;<!-- -->&lt;br&gt;</p>
<h3>Tools I can use</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.firsttimersonly.com/">First Timers Only</a>, great guidelines on how/why to contribute</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions">First contributions</a>, practice environment to make your first ever contribution</li>
<li><a href="https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/">How to Contribute to Open Source</a>, beautifully done website describing every aspect of open-source contribution</li>

</ul>
<p>I hope that this short article will help some of you to start contributing to the open-source as it is a very rewarding process.</p>

<h5>Forking</h5>
<p>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</p>
<p>Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else&#x27;s project or to use someone else&#x27;s project as a starting point for your own idea.</p>
<p><em>From Github Help</em>, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Link</a></p>
<h5>Cloning</h5>
<p>When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.</p>
<p><em>From Github Help</em>, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/">Link</a></p>
<h5>Branching (version control)</h5>
<p>Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.</p>
<p><em>From Atlassian</em>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches">Link</a></p>
<p>You can visualise a Git repository as a tree, with its trunk being <em>master</em> (branch) and every branch its own encapsulation as mentioned before. This allows a developer to work on a feature without taking major risks in altering important code and allowing her or him to backtrack whenever necessary.</p>
<h5>Commiting</h5>
<p>Used to save changes to the local repository. The developer tells git which changes they want to include and run the <code>git commit</code> command. Note that these changes are only saved <strong>localy</strong> and not on the remote server.</p>
<h5>Pushing</h5>
<p>Used to <em>push</em> commits (as mentioned above) to the remote repository.</p>
<h5>Pull request</h5>
<p>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you&#x27;ve pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.</p>
