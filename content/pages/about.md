👋 I'm Christopher Kade, a Front End developer from Paris, France. 
I love everything Javascript and enjoy teaching it through code and words.

I've been doing web development for over 5 years and enjoy working with technologies such as React, Vue and Node. I put great emphasis on code quality, testing and performance throughout my projects.

I've discovered teaching through writing articles and really enjoy it, 
I've kept writing ever since and plan on doing training sessions in the future. 👨‍🏫

Other than coding I really enjoy traveling, playing video games (MMOs, MOBAs, RPGs etc.), cooking and playing music ! I also try to find enough time to work on side-projets each week.
