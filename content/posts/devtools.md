This may sound crazy, but developers are lazy. I know, unbelievable. Some of us are, we need to automate lots of our tasks because repetition can be tiring. So let me show you some tools I find extremely useful, either because they make my life easier or because they push me to write more accessible code.

> We've all done it. Type `ls` you lazy, lazy person !
