Implementing internationalization (commonly known as `i18n`) is often feared by a lot of Front-End developers. Setting it up, adding new languages on the fly & UX are often main concerns when it comes to it.

Thankfully, [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) makes the whole process extremely easy. In this short post, I'll cover how to set up i18n for a Nuxt application, step by step.

The finished product can be found on Codesandbox [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/nuxt-i18n-example-sppzc).

### Step 1: Installing `vue-i18n` and setting it up

We'll use the well known [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n) package to handle internationalization.

Start by installing it:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install vue-i18n

# Using yarn
yarn add vue-i18n
```

Then, define it as a plugin in our configuration file:

```js
// nuxt.config.js

export default {
  // ...

  plugins: ["~/plugins/i18n.js"],

  // ...
};
```

We now need to create the aforementioned `i18n.js` file that will configure our plugin:

```js
// plugins/i18n.js

import Vue from "vue";
import VueI18n from "vue-i18n";

// Tell Vue to use our plugin
Vue.use(VueI18n);

export default ({ app }) => {
  // Set the i18n instance on app
  // This way we can use it globally in our components through this.$i18n
  app.i18n = new VueI18n({
    // Set the initial locale
    locale: "en",

    // Set the fallback locale in case the current locale can't be found
    fallbackLocale: "en",

    // Associate each locale to a content file
    messages: {
      en: require("~/static/content-en.json"),
      fr: require("~/static/content-fr.json"),
    },
  });
};
```

Don't forget to create your `json` files that will contain your textual values for each language. In our case, we could have:

```json
// static/content-en.json
{
  "title": "Hello, how are you?"
}
```

and

```json
// static/content-fr.json
{
  "title": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"
}
```

We'll be able to access each one of these values in our components like so:

```js
// Will return the correct string based on the current locale
this.$t("title");
```

### Step 2: Changing our locale on the fly

All we have to do is update the `i18n` context object's `locale` attribute when we need to change the language.

Here's a method that takes care of it:

```js
changeLanguage(lang) {
  // Change the i18n context object's locale
  // This makes it so the correct locale file is used
  this.$i18n.locale = lang;
}
```

And here's this method used in the context of a component:

```html
<template>
  <section>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>

    <div>
      <button @click="changeLanguage('en')">EN</button>
      <button @click="changeLanguage('fr')">FR</button>
    </div>
  </section>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    computed: {
      title() {
        // this.$t("title") returns the value of our title attribute in our JSON file
        // The correct file is selected based on the locale value
        // If it was an object, we could access its attributes like so: this.$t("myObject").myAttribute
        return this.$t("title");
      },
    },
    methods: {
      /**
       * Called when a language button is clicked
       * Changes the i18n context variable's locale to the one selected
       */
      changeLanguage(lang) {
        this.$i18n.locale = lang;
      },
    },
  };
</script>
```

### Step 3: Wait, there's no step 3?

Yeah, that's pretty much all you need to know to handle i18n in a Nuxt application.  
Of course, there are many ways of customizing your user experience as can be seen in the official [documentation](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/introduction.html).

I hope this has helped some of you figure our i18n in the context of your Nuxt projects.
