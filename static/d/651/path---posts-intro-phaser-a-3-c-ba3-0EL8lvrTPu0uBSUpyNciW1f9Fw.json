We then create a sprite in our canvas. Let’s not forget that all of this is accessible thanks to our HTTP server, just serve the right directory and launch <code class=\"language-text\">http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port/part3.html</code> in your browser of choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"460\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part3.png\">\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>World Building</strong>: where we build a scene with a background and platforms. Similar to the previous section, but it is composed of a <code class=\"language-text\">sky</code> background instead of the <code class=\"language-text\">star</code>, the former is a 800x600 PNG that fills the game screen. We also create a <code class=\"language-text\">platform</code> group that contains the ground and the 2 ledges we can jump on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"460\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part4.png\">\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Groups (and a player)</strong>: where we learn about the usage of <code class=\"language-text\">group</code>s, as they allow to group together similar objects and control them as one unit (we have already created a group that contained the platforms). We then create a new variable called player giving it a position and a sprite sheet (loaded in the <em>Loading assets</em> part), enable its physics, set its physics properties (bounce, gravity &#x26; collisions) and finally add its walking animations (right and left), while defining the corresponding images in our sprite sheet, the amount of FPS and if it should loop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/dude.png\">\n  <br>\n  Here&apos;s what our player&apos;s sprite sheet looks like, it contains our running and standing frames\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"460\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15229355/32609741-8dd1362c-c558-11e7-9f93-e32ca03b4a1d.png\">\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Body and velocity (physics)</strong>: where we learn that <em>Phaser</em> supports a lot of different physics systems (it ships with Arcade and Ninja and P2.JS Full-Body Physics). We must enable the physics property for every sprite or group that should be affected. This gives a new <code class=\"language-text\">body</code> property to our element which offers a lot of properties such as <code class=\"language-text\">player.body.gravity.y</code>. We also notice that the player does not stand on the ground we have set beforehand, that’s because we need to introduce a <em>collision check</em> between the player and the platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"460\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part6.png\">\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: where we set up our keyboard controls. To do so we start by setting our player’s body velocity to 0 in order to reset his movements, then we define a <code class=\"language-text\">cursors</code> variable containing <code class=\"language-text\">game.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys()</code> that will be checked at every frame in <code class=\"language-text\">update()</code> in order to catch a keypress, for example if <code class=\"language-text\">cursors.left.isDown</code> is true, then our user has pressed the left key. We can also let our user jump by checking if he is touching the ground (in order to avoid mid-air jumps) and if the up key has been pressed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goals</strong>: in this part, we create a star group that contains 12 stars to our scene (evenly spread out), set each of their gravity value and randomly assign a bounce value (between 0 - no bounce and 1 - full bounce). Let’s not forget to enable physics for every star using <code class=\"language-text\">stars.enableBody = true</code> and to add collision between our newly created stars and the platform. Finally, using the <code class=\"language-text\">overlap</code> method, we catch when our player touches a star and call the <code class=\"language-text\">collectStar</code> method that simply kills a star in order to have it disapear from the scene using <code class=\"language-text\">star.kill()</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"460\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part8.png\">\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Score</strong>: finally, using the <code class=\"language-text\">Phaser.Text</code> object, we add the player’s score in the scenes top-left. We also add an incrementation in the previously created <code class=\"language-text\">collectStar</code> method and change the text at the same time to display the player’s progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"460\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://phaser.io/content/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part9.png\">\n</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"thoughts-on-this-tutorial\"><a href=\"#thoughts-on-this-tutorial\" aria-label=\"thoughts on this tutorial permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Thoughts on this tutorial</h3>\n<p>This tutorial was a pleasure to go through, it explains Phaser’s core concepts with the right amount of details, is illustrated and progresses to a reasonable pace.
